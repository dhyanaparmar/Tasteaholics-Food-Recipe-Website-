                            <br>1 Tablespoon Kasuri Methi
                            <br>Fresh Coriander 


                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Add cold water gradually in the flour and knead a stiff & tight dough, knead the dough well for 7-8 minutes, after kneading cover the dough with a damp cloth and rest for 30 minutes. By the time you can prepare the filling.
                            <br>2. For filling, we need to make the ginger & green chilli paste, for that, add green chillies & ginger in a grinding jar and grind into a fine paste, keep the paste aside to be used later in making the filling.
                            <br>3. Further, take a mortar & pestle, add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, & fennel seeds and grind to a coarse powder, you can also grind the spices in a mixer grinder, keep the powder aside to be used later in making the filling.
                            <br>4. Cut the boiled potatoes in quarters and further slice them, keep aside for making filling.
                            <br>5. Set a pan or a wok on low heat, add ghee, further add the grounded spices & briefly cook on low heat for 30-40 seconds, now add the ginger chilli paste, stir & cook for 1-2 minutes on low flame, further add the boiled potatoes, green peas, salt & pepper to taste, chaat masala, kasuri methi and freshly chopped coriander leaves, stir well to mix the potatoes and the masala well.
                            <br>6. Increase the flame to medium high & cook the potatoes for 6-7 minutes, it should get some colour while cooking, mash the potatoes lightly while keeping a few chunks intact. Further transfer the mixture in a bowl and allow it to cool down to room temperature. As the filling is ready, you can make the samosa.
                            <br>7. For making samosa, make the samosa sheets, for that, knead the dough once again that has been resting & divide in equal size dough balls, further flatten the dough balls in thin sheets, making an oval shape, make sure the sheet is not too thin or too thick, divide the sheet width wise in two equal halves. Roll the sheet once again after cutting, as the sheet may shrink a little bit. 
                            <br>8. Pick one sheet & apply water on the edge of the straight line, bring the ends together and seal well to shape like a cone, fill sufficient amount of aloo filling, while lightly pressing downwards, bring the openings of the samosa together and seal properly to shape a proper samosa. Shape all the samosa in the same way, make sure to cover with a cloth while youâre shaping other samosa. By the time you can set oil for deep frying.
                            <br>9. For frying, set oil in a big kadhai for deep frying, make sure the kadhai should be wide enough, heat the oil on medium heat and drop in the samosa, fry the samosa on medium heat until they are crisp and golden brown in colour, make sure to fry the samosa in batches but in good quantity that the kadhai is filled but do not overcrowd, make sure the oil should not be too hot, fry the samosa on low to medium flame the samosas are perfectly cooked from inside, adjust the flame accordingly, if you have a thermometer, fry the samosa at 140 â - 150 â.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                            <br> 2 Tablespoon chopped Ginger
                            <br> 2 Tablespoon Spring Onion 
                            <br> 1/2 Cup Onion
                            <br> 1 cup carrot

                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            <br>2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesnât get too brown or overcooked.
                            <br>3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            <br>4. Fill the omelette: Add the fillingâbut donât overstuff the omeletteâwhen the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            <br>5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Set a wok on high heat, add oil, garlic, ginger and spring onion bulbs, stir and cook on high heat for 1-2 minutes.
                            <br>2. Further add the remaining ingredients of the filling, stir & cook on high heat for 1-2 minutes.
                            <br>3. Sprinkle some corn flour, about Â½ tsp and mix well, finish with spring onion greens and mix well, switch off the flame and allow the mixture to cool down, keep the filling aside to be used later.
                            <br>4. In a separate small bowl, mix maida & water to make a lump free slurry.
                            <br>5. Take the spring roll sheet, add sufficient amount of vegetable filling, start to fold the either ends inwards to seal the openings, further roll tightly to keep the fillings intact, apply little slurry on the edges and roll to seal the edges, if there are any openings or if you notice a minor crack developing on the sheets just simply apply the slurry and deep fry them. Make all the spring rolls in same way.
                            <br>6. Set a wok on medium heat filled with oil, drop in the spring rolls in hot oil and deep fry them on medium heat until crisp and golden brown in colour.
                            <br>7. Hot & crispy spring rolls are ready, cut them in pieces and serve them hot with ketchup or any dip of your choice.

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>115 grams unsalted Butter
                            <br>1/2 cup grams Caster Sugar 
                            <br>1/2 cup light brown sugar
                            <br>30ml water
                            <br>1 Teaspoon Oil
                            <br>1 Teaspoon baking powder
                            <br>1 Teaspoon Vanilla essence 
                            <br>1+1/3 cups Refined flour
                            <br>1/2 Teaspoon Baking soda
                            <br>Salt to taste 
                            <br> 150 grams Dark Chocolate 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Add the melted butter, caster sugar & light brown sugar into a large bowl & mix until everything combines.
                            <br>2. Further add the water, oil & baking powder in a separate bowl & whisk well, add this mixture into the butter & sugar along with vanilla essence, whisk well until everything comes together. This mixture is a substitute for egg, if you consume eggs then replace it with 1 whole egg.
                            <br>3. Once you wet mixture is ready, sieve in the refined flour, corn flour, baking soda & salt, mix well using a spatula until all the ingredients combine.
                            <br>4. After the cookie dough comes together, roughly chop & add in the dark chocolate chunks & mix well, I prefer using chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips as they give a better result, if you are using chocolate chips then add 1 cup or 170 grams. Your chocolate chip cookie dough is ready.
                            <br>5. Portion out the dough using a scooper or using a spoon & your hands into 60 gram cookie doughballs, you can adjust the size as per your preference.
                            <br>6. Once you have shaped all the cookie doughballs, cover them using a cling film & set them in the fridge for 45 minutes to an hour.
                            <br>7. Preheat the oven to 175C.
                            <br>8. Once the cookie doughballs have set, place them onto a butter paper lined baking tray, make sure to place them 2-3 inches apart as they will spread & bake them for 10-12 minutes.
                            <br>9. Remove the tray from the oven once the cookies have baked & sprinkle some flakey salt & let the cookies cool down for 8-10 minutes, do not move or lift them while they are still hot or else, they will collapse.
                            <br>10. Your delicious & perfect chocolate chip cookies are ready.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Wash & wipe all the sweet potatoes & peel them.
                            <br>2. Further cut the sweet potato into long & thick (1cm x 1 cm) french fries.
                            <br>3. Wash the cut fries in cold water until the water turns clear.
                            <br>4. Set a stock pot with water over high flame & bring it over a roaring boil, then add the salt & vinegar.
                            <br>5. Add the cut fries into the boiling water, cover & blanch them for 3 minutes.
                            <br>6. Then strain them from the water & transfer them into a sieve & let them cool down to room temperature.
                            <br>7. Once cooled, carefully drop these into 185Â°-190Â° C hot oil & fry them for 1 minute. 
                            <br>8. Transfer them into a sieve using a spider & let them cool down to room temperature again. 
                            <br>9. You can freeze these for later use at this stage. 
                            <br>10. Once cooled, add them into the hot (180-185Â°C) oil again & fry them over medium to low heat until golden brown & crisp.
                            <br>11. Once fried remove them from the hot oil & let all the oil drain off  & transfer them into a bowl. 
                            <br>12. Sprinkle salt & black pepper according to your taste & toss the fries to coat well, you can serve them at this stage or you can add the further spices to make masala fries. 
                            <br>13. Your crisp & delicious sweet potato fries are ready.
